# Cross configuration for cross-compilation
# This helps cross find system dependencies like OpenSSL

[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# Use the default cross Docker image which includes OpenSSL
# The image is automatically selected based on the target triple
# Cross images come with libssl-dev pre-installed, so no additional setup needed

[build]
# Pass through environment variables needed for OpenSSL
# cross will automatically handle PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS
